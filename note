Hello, as you probably know Requiem overhaul was using Silver Knight armor for Tyranus, since Requiem 4.0 Tyranus is back to default outfit so I made a patch to give him Silver Knight again and Ive been thinking about uploading it to Nexus with your permission. Its only patch so it requires original mod.
